# N-QueensGame
It is a game based on N-Queens problem solved using Backtracking where you have to place N queens on a NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
          
# Workflow

Provide a value for the size of the chessboard and click on the button "Start Game"

Place N queens on the NxN chessboard such that no two queens clash each other by being in the same row, column or diagonal

When we place a queen in a cell, check for clashes with already placed queens is performed.
First, cells below and above the cell with queen placed, are checked to identify clash in the same column.
Then, cells right and left to the cell with queen placed, are checked to identify clash in the same row.
Lastly, left and right diagonals are checked.
If either of the checks returns true, i.e., there's a clash, the threatened queens' cells will be marked with red color.

The game gets over when all N queens are placed according to the rule in the board.
